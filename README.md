## About The Project

The Buzz was a project completed as a project for CSE216 Software Engineering at Lehigh University. The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning social media platform which includes both web and mobile front ends, a backend, and an admin command line interface. Another important goal of the project was to use the software development lifecycle using Agile principles in a team environment. The semester-long project was split into 4 sprints, in which each team member would be assigned a role, which included one for each component mentioned above as well as the project manager position.
