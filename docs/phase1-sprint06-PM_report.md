## General questions \[15 points total\]

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)?  
   Yes  
     
2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?  
   Yes   
     
3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.  
     
   * Comment both on the sprint as a whole, as well as on the the individual members efforts.  
   * Comment both on the app design as a whole, as well as on the design and implementation of individual components.  
   * As PM, you should request each non-PM member to evaluate and report on how well requirements related to their efforts were met in this sprint.  
     * For example, how well did each member balance and make best use of their time across their individual work, as tutorial and group-work (including class time, if relevant).

   The team worked mainly separately to complete this week's sprint but we met multiple times to go through the requirements and help each other with our portions. We then all got together to finalize our design and film a video.

   

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"  
     
   * If incomplete, what challenges are being overcome, how are they being overcome, and by when will the team member be able to finish?  
   * If complete, how do you know everyone completed the work, and at a satisfactory level?

   Each member has completed the activities for this week's sprint. We checked over and finalized everyone's work in person.

   

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"  
     
   * More details will follow on code reviews.  
   * For now, report out on **when** (once? multiple times?) and **how** (in person? zoom? Watching a recording?) each member showed *and discussed* their progress.  
     * Was this done individually with the PM, or together as a team?  
     * Did you watch each other’s videos? Did you each look at each others’ jira boards and git commit history?  
     * Did you notify each other via slack as you completed each tutorial?  
     * Were these reviews scheduled, or "on-demand" / as completed?

   We met on zoom to get verbal updates from each member on the status of their tasks, and confirmed visually in person as well as had check-ins on Slack if there were any problems. I went over the code with each person and checked it on their branches to make sure it was done and working.

   

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?  
   Daily check-ins with the team and encouraged them to reach out with any problems. Made sure the backend was up and running before anything else.  
     
7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?  
   Met often, checked in often and made sure everyone was where they needed to be.  
     
8. How well is the team communicating?  
     
   * What is the nature of the conversations? Is it all business, or are you getting to know each other better in small and various ways?  
   * Has one or more team members been communicating infrequently, only after a long delay, or in a non-transparent way?  
     * If so, what did you and/or the team do about this? How was this handled?  
     * What was the reaction?  
     * Has communication improved?

   The team is communicating decently well. It is often hard to find time and get responses about when everyone can meet but generally people respond pretty quickly on Slack. he conversations tend to be mostly business and check-ins but the team overall has been getting along very well. 

   

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.  
     
   * Some examples you may have reached consensus on are:  
     * acceptable and unacceptable behaviors,  
     * frequency of asynchronous communication (e.g. slack),  
     * regularity of "live" check-ins (in person, or on e.g. zoom),  
     * turn-taking or "stage sharing" during live meetings,  
     * safe ways to express discomfort or disagreement should emotions or tensions flare.

   Our expectations for our team are the same as weeks prior, open and honest communication and to not be afraid to voice an opinion, setting and meeting realistic deadlines, using recitation time for work or if having any issues but expected to have most of the weeks work done by recitation time, pushing regularly to git so team members can observe and reference other's work.

   

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is \[1\] itemized, \[2\] briefly described, \[3\] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and \[4\] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.  
      
    * Challenge: XYZ  
      * Status: (resolved or unresolved)  
      * Description:  
      * Critical steps taken to find resolution:

    

11. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?  
      
    * Consider this an opportunity to run a mini [sprint retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(software_development\))  
        
      A sprint retrospective is a separate meeting that allows team members to internally analyze strengths and weaknesses of the sprint, future areas of improvement, and continuous process improvement actions  
        
    * An example of something you might "start" doing is including a retrospective at the end of each sprint, or checking in more frequently on slack, or respectfully checking in on expectations of eachother.  
    * An example of something you might "stop" is waiting three or more days to begin the sprint work.  
    * An example of something you might "continue" is demonstrating open, honest, transparent communication.

    We need to start utilizing jira to keep track of everyone's tasks and status as well as staying proactive on slack for this, and start as early as possible as the upcoming weeks will be busy and challenging to manage. I want us to continue to ask when in need of help and continue to get along and communicate well with each other.

### Project Management

Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?  
   *   
2. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?  
   * Started using it too late within the sprint but got there eventually. Could use more detail on it.  
3. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?  
   * Met both in person and on zoom to check in with each other, also used slack and imessage to get in touch for help if needed  
4. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.  
   * No changes from last week, we use Slack regularly and if we have split up work, we get together to go over it and ask questions.  
5. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping things so constructive?  
   * No team issues with the culture and we are all willing to help each other when in need.
