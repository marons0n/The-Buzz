## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
    * Yes
2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * Yes

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    * We met them fully, we worked on each aspect of the design and made new and updated diagrams where needed. While there is some uncertainty about how all of the components - especially the routes - will play out when we start coding, we updated all of the diagrams, stories, routes, and everything else to our best understanding. 
    * We worked together over zoom to get this done, so we saw everyone's progress live and were able to check in as we worked. 

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * The only challenge this week was some team members being unavailable until late on Sunday due to travel, but we made it work and were flexible with the time we could meet so we ended up being able to collaborate and get everything done. 

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * Due to this being a design week there wasn't a lot of code to review - the only coding we did was fixing up any problems from the previous week. In order to collaborate and check in on each other's work, we worked on the design synchronously on zoom. 

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * Due to this being a design week, a lot of the work was done in class by listening to the description of the new phase and reading through the phase 3 description in coruse site - so we were fairly prepared to get the design done when we got together. We checked in throughout the week on slack to find a time that worked for everyone to meet, and while that ended up being Sunday, the planning worked for us and we were able to complete it. 

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * Meeting synchronously helped us work together, as we could check in at every step if there was confusion, or to appropriately delegate tasks. 

8. How well is the team communicating?
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * We are communicating fairly well. Our main difficulty is aligning schedules to be able to meet in person or over zoom, since many of the members have prior commitments often. However, we send lots of slack messages when we need to meet and generally end up finding a time. Most of the slack or zoom check-ins are business, but when we work together in person we are getting to know each other. When a team member is not responding, we fix it by pinging them directly or texting them by their phone number in case they are not getting slack notifications, and this generally resolves the issue. Communication has improves as the semester has gone on and we have needed to be in contact more. 

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    * Our expectations are to be communicative and get our work done, and to ask for help when needed. There have not been changes from last week. 

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * This was a fairly light week as it was just the design week. Our only issue was:
    1.  knowing whether we needed updated routes or not, which has not been resolved but will be this week once we start coding and getting to understand the technical requirements of the sprint. 

## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We did not meet with our mentor this sprint as it was just from Wednesday to Sunday, so there was not recitation and we didn't need help. 

1. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * The Jira usage was again fairly light this week as it was a design week and didn't require much planning other than delegation of tasks and meeting to film the recording. 

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * Meetings were held over zoom and were scheduled on slack. On slack we also gave updates on our progress and our schedules. 

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    * We did daily check-ins on slack to communicate where our week's progress was at. 

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    * No team issues other than some scheduling difficulties - those can be resolved by planning a meeting sooner in this upcoming sprint rather than in the latter half. 

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * Making sure everyone has time to meet with TAs if needed and is able to work synchronously despite exams, Thanksgiving/travel coming up. Also, making sure we collaborate from the start on difficult parts, so frontend/mobile and backend don't go down different paths and are able to work together. 

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * Difficulties scheduling a meeting - other than that, a pretty smooth sprint. 

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    * Start scheduling team meetings sooner in the week. Continue regular check-ins on slack and everyone being communicative. 

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    * Our time estimate was fairly accurate, since we have done a few design sprints by now and are able to predict how long each component takes. Again, most of the work is done in class listening to the description and on our own time reading over the phase description, and these aspects took around the same time as they did in the past, or a bit shorter since we are getting more efficient. 

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * Some aspects of the project need to be tested and reviewed by everyone, as some problems were still being fixed up throughout the week. Most of the issues we had last week like oAuth have been fixed. 
    * Performance could be something to think about as the database could grow much larger. 
    * User experience could also be reviewed as the appearance of the mobile and the frontend are a bit different and could cause confusion for users.
